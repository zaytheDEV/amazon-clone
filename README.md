<b>Main Objective</b></br>
This was my very first React project. So, watching tutorials and following along allowed me to get a better understanding of how React works. This was a very difficult project for my level and understanding of front-end development at the time. The main idea for this project was to style the clone to look like Amazon and connect a React app to a database. I also received practice working with APIs using Stripe to take pseudo payments. 

<b>Recap</b></br>
Looking back at my code for this project, it was advanced and clean for a beginner coder. There are many things that I would have changed if I were to redo this project today. The first is the folder and component organization. Components and styles were all in one folder. There was no organization. Also, I would have used CSS modules and SASS to style each component. I wanted to keep the folder setup and the written code the way it was to provide a roadmap on how I developed as a front-end dev. Though as a first project, I think it still was developed very well.
